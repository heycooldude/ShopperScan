# ShopperScan
ShopperScan is an app which will scan your items and you pay it. You don't have to stand in a long queue waiting for check out. Scan the bar code, pay the amount and you are all set!


* Our aim is to reduce the never ending queue at check out in a shopping store. 

* This idea came up when we were waiting for checkout in the Walmart store

* Scan the barcode of your item and check out.
